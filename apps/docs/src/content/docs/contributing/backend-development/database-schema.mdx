description: Learn about the database schema used in Invoicen.

Invoicen uses a PostgreSQL database to store data. The database schema is designed to be simple, efficient, and scalable.
This page provides an overview of the database schema used in Invoicen.

Let me break down the key aspects of this schema:

1. Multi-Tenancy Model:
  - `users` table contains core user information
  - `organizations` represents different accounts/apps
  - `userOrganizations` is a junction table that allows users to be part of multiple organizations with different roles

2. Role-Based Access Control:
  - `userRoleEnum` defines roles: owner, admin, editor, viewer
  - Users can have different roles in different organizations

3. Invoice Management:
  - `invoiceTemplates` allows custom templates per organization
  - `invoices` table tracks invoice details
  - `invoiceLineItems` for granular line item tracking

4. Flexible Design:
  - UUID primary keys for scalability
  - Timestamp tracking for audit purposes
  - JSON support for template data (for your Figma-like template editor)

5. Enum Support:
  - `userRoleEnum` for consistent role management
  - `invoiceStatusEnum` for standardized invoice statuses

## Key Features:
- A user can belong to multiple organizations
- Role-based permissions per organization
- Template management with JSON storage
- Comprehensive invoice tracking

## Recommendations:
- Use Drizzle ORM for type-safe database interactions
- Consider adding indexes for performance
- Implement access control logic in your application layer based on roles
