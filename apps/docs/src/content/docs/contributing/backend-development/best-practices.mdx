Invoicen is built with a focus on simplicity, performance, and maintainability. To ensure that the frontend codebase remains consistent and scalable, we follow a set of best practices.

## Follow a modular approach

Invoicen is a large application with multiple features and components. To manage the complexity and ensure maintainability, we follow a modular approach to backend development.
Each feature or component is encapsulated within its own module, making it easier to understand, test, and update.

## Avoid `any` type

When you declare a variable as any, TypeScript's type checker doesn't perform any type checking, making it possible to assign any type of values to the variable. TypeScript uses type inference to determine the type of variable based on the value. By declaring it as `any`, TypeScript can no longer infer the type.
This makes it hard to catch type-related errors during development, leading to runtime errors and makes the code less maintainable, less reliable, and harder to understand for others.

This is why everything should have a type. So if you create a new object with a first name and last name, you should create an interface or type that contains a first name and last name that defines the shape of the object you are manipulating.
