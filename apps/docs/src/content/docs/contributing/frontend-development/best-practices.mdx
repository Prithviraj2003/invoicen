description: Learn about the best practices for frontend development in Invoicen.
---

Invoicen is built with a focus on simplicity, performance, and maintainability. To ensure that the frontend codebase remains consistent and scalable, we follow a set of best practices.

## Loading State

When fetching data from the server, it's essential to provide feedback to the user. Use loading states to indicate that the data is being fetched.
We use skeleton loaders to provide a seamless transition between loading and displaying data.

## Error Handling

Handle errors gracefully by displaying error messages to the user. Use toast notifications or modals to inform users about errors and guide them on how to resolve them.

## Validation

Ensure that user inputs are validated on the client-side before submitting data to the server. Use form validation libraries or custom validation logic to prevent invalid data from being submitted.

## Responsive Design

Invoicen is designed to be responsive and accessible across devices. Ensure that your components are responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.

## Accessibility

Follow accessibility best practices to ensure that the application is usable by all users, including those with disabilities. Use semantic HTML elements, provide alt text for images, and ensure that the application is navigable using a keyboard.

## Console.logs

`console.log` statements are valuable during development, offering real-time insights into variable values and code flow. But, leaving them in production code can lead to several issues:

- **Performance**: Excessive `console.log` statements can slow down the application.
- **Security**: Logging sensitive data can expose it to attackers.
- **Cleanliness**: Codebase readability is affected by unnecessary logs.
- **Professionalism**: Logs can be seen by users, affecting the application's professional appearance.

Ensure that all `console.log` statements are removed before deploying code to production.

## Naming

Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and components. This improves code readability and makes it easier for other developers to understand your code.

Use `camelCase` for variable names and `pascal-case` for file names.

### Variable Naming

The issue with generic names

Generic names in programming are not ideal because they lack specificity, leading to ambiguity and reduced code readability. Such names fail to convey the variable or function's purpose, making it challenging for developers to understand the code's intent without deeper investigation. This can result in increased debugging time, higher susceptibility to errors, and difficulties in maintenance and collaboration. Meanwhile, descriptive naming makes the code self-explanatory and easier to navigate, enhancing code quality and developer productivity.

```js
// ❌ Bad, uses a generic name that doesn't communicate its
//    purpose or content clearly
const [value, setValue] = useState('');
```

```js
// ✅ Good, uses a descriptive name
const [email, setEmail] = useState('');
```

### Event Handlers

When naming event handlers, use the `handle` prefix followed by the action or event name. This convention makes it clear that the function is an event handler and improves code readability.

```ts
// ❌ Bad
const onEmailChange = (val: string) => {
  // ...
};
```

```ts
// ✅ Good
const handleEmailChange = (val: string) => {
  // ...
};
```

### Optional Props

Avoid passing the default value for an optional prop.

Take theEmailField component defined below:

```tsx
type EmailFieldProps = {
  value: string;
  disabled?: boolean;
};

const EmailField = ({ value, disabled = false }: EmailFieldProps) => (
  <TextInput value={value} disabled={disabled} fullWidth />
);
```

Usage

```tsx
/ ❌ Bad, passing in the same value as the default value adds no value
const Form = () => <EmailField value="username@email.com" disabled={false} />;
```

```tsx
// ✅ Good, assumes the default value
const Form = () => <EmailField value="username@email.com" />;
```

### Component as props

Try as much as possible to pass uninstantiated components as props, so children can decide on their own of what props they need to pass.

The most common example for that is icon components:

```tsx
const SomeParentComponent = () => <MyComponent Icon={MyIcon} />;

// In MyComponent
const MyComponent = ({ MyIcon }: { MyIcon: IconComponent }) => {
  const theme = useTheme();

  return (
    <div>
      <MyIcon size={theme.icon.size.md}>
    </div>
  )
};
```

For React to understand that the component is a component, you need to use PascalCase, to later instantiate it with `<MyIcon>`

### Prop Drilling: Keep It Minimal

Prop drilling, in the React context, refers to the practice of passing state variables and their setters through many component layers, even if intermediary components don't use them. While sometimes necessary, excessive prop drilling can lead to:

1. **Decreased Readability**: Tracing where a prop originates or where it's utilized can become convoluted in a deeply nested component structure.
2. **Maintenance Challenges**: Changes in one component's prop structure might require adjustments in several components, even if they don't directly use the prop.
3. **Reduced Component Reusability**: A component receiving a lot of props solely for passing them down becomes less general-purpose and harder to reuse in different contexts.

If you feel that you are using excessive prop drilling, see [state management best practices](#state-management).

### Imports

When importing, opt for the designated aliases rather than specifying complete or relative paths.

## Schema Validation

[Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) is the schema validator for untyped objects:

```js
const validationSchema = z
  .object({
    exist: z.boolean(),
    email: z
      .string()
      .email('Email must be a valid email'),
    password: z
      .string()
      .regex(PASSWORD_REGEX, 'Password must contain at least 8 characters'),
  })
  .required();

type Form = z.infer<typeof validationSchema>;
```


## Breaking Changes

Always perform thorough manual testing before proceeding to guarantee that modifications haven’t caused disruptions elsewhere, given that tests have not yet been extensively integrated.
