## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) (and Docker Compose)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com)

---

## Step 1: Clone the Repository
1. [Fork](https://github.com/keizerworks/invoicen/fork) the repository by clicking on the fork button on the top right corner of the repository page.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<username>/invoicen.git
```
> Replace `<username>` with your GitHub username.

3. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Check the [Environment Variables](/getting-started/environment-variables) page for more information about the environment variables.

## Step 2: Setup the Environment
You can set up the environment using one of the following methods:

### Using Docker Compose

This option simplifies the setup process by using pre-configured Docker services for PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO, and Mailhog.

Once you have `.env` setup and Docker installed, you can run the following command to start the services:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

If you want to stop the services, you can run the following command:

```bash
docker compose down
```

This command will start following services in background:
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) (Database)
- [Redis](https://redis.io) (Cache)
- [MinIO](https://min.io) (Object Storage)
- [Mailhog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) (Email Testing)

#### Troubleshooting Docker Compose
If you are facing issues with Docker Compose, you can try the following:

1. Ensure Docker is running.
1. Check the `.env` file for any missing or incorrect values.
1. Check the logs using the following command:

```bash
docker logs <container_name>
```

### Using Local Services

If you prefer to use local services, you can set up [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org), [Redis](https://redis.io), [MinIO](https://min.io), and [Mailhog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) manually.
Please refer to their documentation to set them up locally.

#### Troubleshooting Local Services
If you are facing issues with local services, you can try the following:
1. Ensure the services are running.
1. Check the `.env` file for any missing or incorrect values.
1. Check the logs of the services for any errors.

## Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install the project dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Step 4: Start the Development Server
To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm dev
```
